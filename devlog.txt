DEVLOG:
2016-01-11
Set up git repo with readme.md and devlog.txt
-EV and WB

2016-01-12
Created tentative list of classes along with their properties and methods.
Will be useful for initial planning. This list can be found in classList.txt
-EV and WB

2016-01-13
Wrote initial version of MurderSituation class with necessary properties
and methods.
-EV and WB

2016-01-13
Started and/or expanded and revised: Card, Player, MurderSituation, and LivingPlayer.
In the process, figured out more efficient Card class design.
-EV

2016-01-14
Create public static Card[] arrays in Game for storing all the possible
cards in the Game, with one array for each type (person, place, weapon).
Make some instance variables private (in Card and MurderSituation) which
has been unnecessarily public.
-WB

2016-01-15
Solidifed structure of Notesheet class and began implementing Notesheet
along with NotesheetItem (to aid structure of Notesheet).
-EV and WB

2016-01-16
Finished initial versions of Notesheet and NotesheetItem classes.
Completed game initialization and card dealing of Game class.
-EV

2016-01-16
Write an implementation of accuse() in LivingPlayer and a placeholder
implementation of suspect() (returning null). Also change many instance
variable names to have leading underscores, to be consistent with the
convention we are using.
-WB

2016-01-17
Debugged card dealing mechanism. Finished initial version of LivingPlayer
suspect() method, but the rotating of players in getting information is
slightly buggy but that will be fixed.
-EV

2016-01-18
Fixed bugginess of getting information from players. Ensured functionality
of basic suspect/accuse mechanism. Wrote in the ability to accuse after
making a suspicion as the game does. Finished AutoPlayer, and changed
functionality of getting information to account for differences between
LivingPlayer and AutoPlayer. Also cleaned up the getInfo() method that
used to be long/messy/gross by separating it into its significant parts.
-EV

2016-01-18
Changed the SOPs in accuse() to restate the choices the player made,
fixed suspect() to properly use helpUserSelectCard for helping with
user input, and make Card automatically normalize the case of the
name of its input in its constructor (i.e.
  (new Card("miss scarlet", 0)).getName() will be "Miss Scarlet")
-WB

2016-01-19
Added rules and backstory to Game. Added ability to append personal
comments to notesheet.
-EV

2016-01-19
Fixed bug in suspect method in LivingPlayer.java which prevented the user
from correcting typing mistakes
-WB

2016-01-19
Improve textual interaction with user, by normalizing inputs and Card names
and displaying back the choices that the players makes while accuse-ing.
-WB

2016-01-20
Make Game acknowledge difference between Living and Auto when allowing
accusation following suspicion. (Moved I/O to LivingPlayer). Also made game
end when the living are out of the game while AutoPlayers are not.
-EV and WB

2016-01-20
Made lots and lots of little changes in the newlines/spaces of the program
so that the information showed to each player followed the rules of the game.
-EV

2016-01-21
Fixed runAccusation() to end once winning accusation is made, and made
user confirm to continue after failed accusation.
-EV and WB

2016-01-23
Make UserIO abstraction for auto-lowercasing some inputs, and allowing
the user to ask to see his/her notesheet at any point during their turn.
Make initGame ask the user for the names of other players immediately
after asking how many friends would be playing, since whenever either of
us play we've expected that to happen and been surprised when it hasn't.
-WB

2016-01-24
Made initAutos() check that number entered is within specified range. (Can't
believe I didn't do this the first time around). Also made sure it doesn't prompt
user for negative number."
-EV

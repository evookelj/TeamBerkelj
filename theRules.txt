RULES:
At the beginning of play, three cards — one suspect, one weapon, 
and one room card — are chosen at random and put into a special envelope, 
so that no one can see them. These cards represent the facts of the case. 
The remainder of the cards are distributed among the players. Because 
these cards are not in the envelope, it is known that these are alibis that 
these nouns are not apart of the murder.
On a player's turn, she makes a suspicion about the murder: an educated guess 
about the details. If the player coming next has information, they must present
it. If they do not, the next player tries, and so on and so forth until 
there are no players left. The player's suggestion only gets disproved once. 
So, though several players may hold cards disproving the suggestion, only 
the first one will show the suggesting player his or her card.
Once a player has sufficiently narrowed the solution, that player can make an 
accusation. According to the rules, 'When you think you have worked out which 
three cards are in the envelope, you may, on your turn, make an Accusation 
and name any three elements you want.' Players may name any room (unlike a 
suspicionon, where a player's character pawn must be in the room the player 
suggests). The accusing player checks the validity of the accusation by 
checking the cards, keeping them concealed from other players. If he has 
made an incorrect accusation, he plays no further part in the game except to 
reveal cards secretly to one of the remaining players when required to do so 
in order to disprove suggestions. If the player made a correct accusation, 
the solution cards are shown to the other players and the game ends.

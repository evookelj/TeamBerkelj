## About

Whodunitz is an in-terminal implementation of the popular board game
Clue.  The players interact with the game through text in the terminal
and Whodunitz will handle "bad" inputs by normalizing them, and if
that doesn't work, giving the user an easier interface for entering,
for example, the name of the character they'd like to suspect.

A few parts of Whodunitz are automated that cannot be in ordinary
Clue. If there are not enough humans to play a good game, the game
will make simple automated players to make the game more interesting.
Instead of the player writing 'X's on a piece of paper, Whodunitz
maitains the players' notesheets automatically, and lets players refer
to their notesheets at any appropriate point during their turn.

Have fun!
